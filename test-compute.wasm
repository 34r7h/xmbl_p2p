# This mock WASM file simulates:
# - File upload for compute tasks
# - Task submission with input data
# - Execution progress tracking
# - Result generation and display

# The functional client should:
# - Accept this WASM file upload
# - Allow JSON input data entry
# - Submit the compute task
# - Show execution progress
# - Display completion results
# - Allow result download

# This demonstrates the complete P2P compute workflow from task submission to result retrieval.
