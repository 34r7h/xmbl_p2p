This is a test file for the XMBL P2P Storage and Compute Network.

File Information:
- Name: test-upload.txt
- Purpose: Testing file upload functionality
- Content: Sample text data for demonstration
- Created: August 2025

This file will be used to test:
1. File upload to the P2P network
2. Redundancy selection (1x to 7x)
3. Storage progress tracking
4. File management operations
5. Network distribution simulation

The functional client should:
- Accept this file upload
- Show progress during storage
- Generate a unique CID
- Assign storage nodes based on redundancy
- Allow download and verification
- Display file status and metadata

This demonstrates the complete P2P storage workflow from upload to network distribution.
