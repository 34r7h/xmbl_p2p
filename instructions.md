# XMBL P2P Storage and Compute Network

## 🚀 PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

**CRITICAL RULE: NO BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES**

Every component must be developed independently with mock dependencies. Teams can work simultaneously without waiting for others.

## 🔑 Development Principles

### 1. **INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT**
- Each crate compiles and tests independently
- No cross-crate dependencies during development
- Use mock types for external dependencies

### 2. **MOCK-FIRST APPROACH**
- Define mock types locally in each crate
- Implement full business logic with mocks
- Easy to swap mocks for real implementations later

### 3. **PARALLEL WORKFLOW**
- All teams start simultaneously
- No waiting for foundational components
- Integration happens at the end

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Independent Development (Week 1-2)**
- All teams work simultaneously
- Each crate implements full functionality with mocks
- No inter-crate dependencies

### **Phase 2: Mock Integration (Week 3)**
- Replace local mocks with shared mock crate
- Test inter-crate communication with mocks
- Validate interfaces and contracts

### **Phase 3: Real Integration (Week 4)**
- Replace mocks with real implementations
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ **NO cross-crate dependencies during development**
- ❌ **NO waiting for other teams**
- ❌ **NO complex integration until Phase 3**
- ❌ **NO shared types until mock integration**

## ✅ What TO Do

- ✅ **Implement full functionality with local mocks**
- ✅ **Test everything independently**
- ✅ **Document all interfaces clearly**
- ✅ **Work in parallel from day 1**

## 🔧 Build Commands

```bash
# Build individual crate
cargo build -p <crate_name>

# Build all crates
cargo build --workspace

# Test individual crate
cargo test -p <crate_name>

# Test all crates
cargo test --workspace
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] All 10 crates compile independently
- [ ] All crates have comprehensive tests
- [ ] Mock dependencies work correctly
- [ ] Teams can work simultaneously
- [ ] Integration path is clear

## 📞 Team Coordination

- **Daily Standups**: 15 minutes, status updates only
- **Weekly Reviews**: Interface validation and mock testing
- **Integration Planning**: Week 3, mock integration testing
- **Final Integration**: Week 4, real implementation swap

**REMEMBER: INDEPENDENCE FIRST, INTEGRATION LAST**
