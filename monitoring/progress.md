## 📈 **Quality Metrics**

### **Code Coverage** 🔄 **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**
- **Current**: Basic functionality only (~40% estimated)
- **Target**: 90%+ coverage with edge cases
- **Status**: Not measured

### **Performance** 🔄 **NEEDS BENCHMARKING**
- **Current**: No performance metrics
- **Target**: Sub-10ms metric collection, efficient memory usage
- **Status**: Not measured

### **Security** 🔄 **NEEDS AUDIT**
- **Current**: Basic implementation only
- **Target**: Input validation, access control, secure metrics
- **Status**: Basic implementation only

## 🚀 **Next Development Tasks**

### **Immediate (This Week)**
1. **Implement real system metrics collection**
   - [ ] Replace random number generation with actual system calls
   - [ ] Add CPU, memory, disk, network monitoring
   - [ ] Implement efficient metric collection

2. **Add comprehensive error handling**
   - [ ] Create custom error types for monitoring failures
   - [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Implement graceful degradation

3. **Enhance alert system**
   - [ ] Configurable alert thresholds
   - [ ] Alert severity levels
   - [ ] Alert acknowledgment workflow

### **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**
1. **Performance optimization**
   - [ ] Benchmark current implementation
   - [ ] Optimize metric collection frequency
   - [ ] Implement metric batching and aggregation

2. **Advanced features**
   - [ ] Metrics persistence and historical analysis
   - [ ] Configurable monitoring intervals
   - [ ] Integration with external systems

## 📝 **Development Notes**
